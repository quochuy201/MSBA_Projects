LEARNING ALGORITHMS</a> 
### Instructor: Dr B.Kim
### Status: completed

## Summary
My study focus on applying Text mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze Customers' reviews on social media and classify the reviews into deceitful and truthful review. This paper aims to improve the performance of fake review classifiers by integrating different techniques into classifying models. More specifically, I analyzed similarity between reviews and utilized the EM (Expectation Maximization) clustering algorithm to recognize the review patterns. I also applied the sentiment analysis to analyze the reviews. Using the results from clustering models, sentiment analysis, and non-textual features of reviews and reviewers, we built machine learning models to classify fake reviews.
